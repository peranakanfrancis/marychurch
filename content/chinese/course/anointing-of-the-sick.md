description : "In the course of life, humans suffer from illnesses of body, mind and spirit. The Sacrament of Anointing confers the healing touch of God on the sick and forgives sin. Sometimes the sacrament restores a person to full health. Sometimes it prepares a person to accept the reality of death, which is a necessary part of human life. In the case of imminent death, the Eucharist is offered as Viaticum, food for the journey to the Father."

> ### "Are any among you sick? They should call for the elders of the church and have them pray over them, anointing them with oil in the name of the Lord. - James 5:14"

### What is Anointing of the Sick?
The Anointing of the Sick is given to the sick and those who are about to depart from this life. This Sacrament unites the suffering of an ill person with that of Christ. It enables forgiveness of their sins, comfort in their suffering, and restores the spirit. For the dying person, the sacrament is for the preparation for the passing over to eternal life.


The Sacrament is administered by a priest or bishop. A penitential rite followed by the Liturgy of the Word opens the celebration. Scripture awakens the faith of the sick and family members and friends to pray to Christ for the strength of his Holy Spirit. The priest lays his hands on the head of the sick person. He then proceeds to anoint, with the blessed Oil of the Sick, the forehead and hands of the sick person (in the Roman Rite). He accompanies these acts with the words, “Through this holy anointing may the Lord in his love and mercy help you with the grace of the Holy Spirit. May the Lord who frees you from sin save you and raise you up” (CCC, no. 1513) Holy Communion may be offered to the dying person.


### To Receive Anointing of the Sick
If you or someone you know are sick and would like to receive the Sacrament of the Anointing of the Sick, please contact our parish Father Louis at [+6045887799](tel:+6045887799) or book an appointment as soon as possible. There is no need to wait until the point of death if the illness is serious. The Sacrament may be repeated if the person recovers and becomes ill again, or if the person’s condition worsens.
